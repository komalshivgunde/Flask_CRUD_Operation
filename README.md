Flask_CRUD_Operation is built on the Flask web framework, a lightweight and flexible Python web application framework.
The project implements CRUD operations, which stand for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are fundamental for managing data in a database.
The application likely interacts with a database to store and retrieve information. Flask supports various database systems, and the specific implementation details depend on the project.
Users can interact with the CRUD operations through a web interface. This interface allows them to perform actions such as adding new records, viewing existing data, updating information, and deleting records.
